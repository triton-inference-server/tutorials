# Guide to Deploying AI Agents with Triton Inference Server

Welcome to the **Guide to Deploying AI Agents with Triton Inference Server**.
This repository provides a set of tutorials designed to help you deploy
AI agents efficiently using the Triton Inference Server. This guide is intended
for users who are already familiar with the basics of Triton and are looking to
expand their knowledge.

For beginners, we recommend starting with the
[Conceptual Guide](tutorials/Conceptual_Guide/README.md), which covers
foundational concepts and basic setup of Triton Inference Server.

## AI agents and Agentic Workflows

Modern large language models (LLMs) are integral components of AI agents â€”
sophisticated self-governing systems that make decisions by interacting with
their environment and analyzing the data they gather. By integrating LLMs,
AI agents can understand, generate, and respond to human language with high
proficiency, enabling them to perform complex tasks such as language
translation, content generation, and conversational interactions.


## Table of Contents

- [Constrained Decoding](Constrained_Decoding/README.md)
    * Learn about constrained decoding, how to implement it in Triton,
    and explore practical examples and use cases.
- [Function Calling](Function_Calling/README.md)
    * Discover how to set up and utilize function calling within AI models using
    Triton. This section includes detailed instructions and examples to help you
    integrate function calling into your deployments.
